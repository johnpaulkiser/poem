### Poem One
ayo

i wanna talk

i wanna call you and talk

i wanna walk to your front door and knock

after i stop my vehicle

drive to your city

cause we live an hour apart

land in your driveway and put it in park

then do the third line of this verse


...

what do you need

do you need bread

do you need this

do you need (a hug)

do you need to be alone

i can wrap this up and get the fuck away instead

what is your wish

it can be granted

you're number 1

one on my list

T, i'm santa

where's rudolph?


### Poem Two

Roses are every color but red....
I dont think that's true..
