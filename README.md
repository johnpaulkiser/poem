### Poem One
ayo

i wanna talk

i wanna call you and talk

i wanna walk to your front door and knock

after i stop my vehicle

drive to your city

cause we live an hour apart

land in your driveway and put it in park

then do the third line of this verse

...

what do you need

do you need bread

do you need this

do you need (a hug)

do you need to be alone

i can wrap this up and get the fuck away instead

what is your wish

it can be granted

you're number 1

one on my list

T, i'm santa

where's rudolph?

### Poem Three
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Wii U the Plagued?

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
