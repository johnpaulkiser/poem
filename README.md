is this free verse because it dose not rhyme 


ayo
i wanna talk
i wanna call you and talk
i wanna walk to your front door and knock
after i stop my vehicle
drive to your city
cause we live an hour apart
land in your driveway and put it in park
then do the third line of this verse


Roses are every color but red....
I dont think that's true..
